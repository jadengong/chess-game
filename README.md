# Chess Game

This project implements an interactive chess game designed to perform key operations like drag-and-drop functionality, turn tracking, and game status updates on a modular 8 x 8 gameboard. The program is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be executed on most IDEs. I personally used VSCode to create this project. 

## How to Run the Code

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE or code editor
2. Launch the game by opening the `index.html` file on a web browser
